      Hi 👋, this website is my attempt at sharing everything I have learned since I started thinking about
      what I'm actually carrying with me on travels.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Through many iterations, I think I'm now at a level where the things
      I'm carrying are truly necessary. Also, I think this is an OCD thing where
      I push myself to bring less every time 😃.
    </p>
    <p  class="paragraph">
      The content of this website isn't a strict codex of things to do, rather it is a set of ideas
      that you can choose to implement if you want to just carry less stuff or be more adventurous, maybe.
      Travel is meant to be discovery, allow yourself to be flexible by travelling light and go with the flow.
    </p>
