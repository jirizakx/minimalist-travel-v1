      <h2>Carry fewer clothes and wash them on the spot.</h2>
      <p>
        This reduces a lot. For me, the sweetspot is 2 extra sets of clothes (T-shirt, socks, etc.),
        and then usually a running T-shirt and shorts (which aren't necessary if your daily shorts are comfortable enough for running,
        or any other sport that you might do). That's it, and it lasts well for 3 days. I'm wearing a hoodie and shorts/jeans on me,
        and anything else, like pyjamas, another pair of shorts, or sweatpants, is a redundancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Washing is easy if you have a washing machine at your disposal; otherwise,
        it is quite effective to wash your clothes in the bathroom sink with some shower gel.
        Though for longer trips, I recommend washing it in a washing machine after, like, 2 weeks üòÉ.

      <h2>Use the default resources offered by your accommodation.</h2>
      <p>
        The vast majority of hotels come with shower gels or shampoos in the shower,
        so you usually don't need to bring your own. And if you encounter accommodation that doesn't have it,
        they can often sell it, or you can buy it at the closest store. The same goes for towels.
      </p>

    <section class="tip">
      <h2>Bring e-readers or maybe even fully replace them with audiobooks or podcasts.</h2>
      <p>
        For shorter trips (especially without big travel distances between intermediary destinations),
        I just have my phone or notebook and headphones for any entertainment I'd want. For longer trips,
        where you might want to bring a book, e-readers are a great option for entertainment.
        Also, don't forget to download books before your trip!
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="tip">
      <h2>Bring just one pair of shoes.</h2>
      <p>
        This is perhaps the most impactful way to reduce the amount of your baggage.
        What shoes to pick? I recommend either some running shoes, barefoots, or just your general-use sneakers.
        If they are comfortable enough, you can walk anything with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, maybe, if you are going to warmer places, some lighter sandals or flip-flops aren't a bad idea.
      </p>

    <section class="tip">
      <h2>Use USB-C for most (or all) of your devices.</h2>
      <p>
        Well, don't buy a new notebook, phone, or electric shaver just so you can charge it with USB-C.
        Rather, take it into consideration when buying something new or when you perhaps have devices to
        choose from for a particular need.
        With my setup, I carry just one 25W USB-C charger for my MacBook, phone, electric razor, and headphones.
        (Which is all I've got except my Garmin watches that I don't really need to charge on most trips.)

      <h2>Steal toothpaste. ü™•</h2>
      <p>
        If you aren't travelling alone, then probably someone in your group is carrying a toothpaste.
        Steal it when they aren't looking or wake up earlier than them! Though if you are ethical,
        just ask them or share something else with them. Also, some hotels come with toothpaste,
        but with a lower probability compared to shampoo.
      </p>

    <section class="tip">
      <h2>Use headphones as earplugs.</h2>
      <p>
        This might be obvious to most people, but it is a useful trick for falling asleep on a plane or a bus,
        especially if they have active noise-cancelling, and it gives an item you are already packing more use cases,
        which is the essence of packing light- multipurposeness.

      <h2>Choose between a headcap or sunglasses</h2>
      <p>
        You don't really need both most of the time (if you aren't going for some style thing) and,
        again, it saves some space. I recommend sunglasses though, because they are smaller and,
        who knows, maybe you'll find yourself on a motorbike somewhere in Southeast Asia and
        there they come in handy against the wind.

      <h2>More indie tips:</h2>
      <ul id="indie-tips-list">
        <li>üíª <a href="https://apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank">MacBook</a> (Air) works well for me, benefits just from travel perspective: the battery is amazing, it's compact,
          big touchpad (no mouse needed)</li>
        <li>üéí I use this <a href="https://www.alza.cz/sport/lenovo-backpack-b210-15-6-sedy-d5259138.htm?o=2" target="_blank">Lenovo Backpack B210 15.6"</a> and it's great, it is for about $15, and it has the ideal size,
          ideal pockets, great shape and colour and is made from decent material.</li>
        <li>üó∫Ô∏è Use <a href="https://mapy.com/" target="_blank">mapy.com</a> - offline downloads, great map quality (much better than Google Maps),
          multiple languages, and more. Premium is for ~$10/year, and it has good features.
          But still for some tasks like facility opening times, international public transport, etc., I use Google Maps.</li>
        <li>You can collect UNESCO places like Pok√©mon with dedicated apps on your phone if you are into that (I am). Geocaching can also be fun while travelling.</li>
